--Description--
This library enables a user to create a file system similar to
the Unix file system design.

When first initialized, the file system contains an empty root
node (with label "/"). The programmer may add children nodes to
the file system which will be added based on the label of the
child.

For example, if after initialization, the user adds a node with
label "/var", the node will be placed in the root nodes
children list. If the user then adds a node with label
"/var/log", the node will be placed in the child list of the
node with label "/var".

A node may hold any data structure (void *) and may have any
number of children. The nodes label must be unique. This means
all nodes should have a different label.
